# What?

[wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) is a popular and fun game. I highly recommend checking it out. The rules are simple which makes it a great subject to use to practice programming.

I'm going to build a wordle game in ruby. My plan is to do it in small increments and see what happens.
